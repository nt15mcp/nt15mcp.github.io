Each council oversees maritime trade, infrastructure, and civic administration within its harbor city, balancing the interests of merchants, artisans, and seafarers.\nThough the councils operate independently, their structure and traditions share a common origin ‚Äî born from early trade accords among Sword Coast port towns seeking to regulate commerce and ensure safe passage between settlements.\n\nOverview\n\nGovernment Type: Civic council\n\nCommon Membership: Merchants, guildmasters, civic officials, and naval representatives\n\nPrimary Duties: Harbor regulation, taxation, trade arbitration, civic order, and defense coordination\n\nSeat of Authority: Typically a public hall or administrative complex overlooking the main docks\n\nStructure and Function\nEach council consists of seven to nine wardens, chosen through election or appointment depending on local custom. A High Harborwarden presides over meetings and represents the council in foreign or intercity matters.\nWhile each harbor‚Äôs priorities differ, all share a commitment to maintaining stability and prosperity through maritime law, infrastructure upkeep, and equitable governance.\n\nRegional Variations\nGrayharbor Council of Harborwardens\nThe council of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/locations/grayharbor/\">Grayharbor</a> emphasizes transparency and civic engagement.
