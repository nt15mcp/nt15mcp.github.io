## **Fragment #7**

> _“Several early Codex entries allude to a danger now lost to memory, one apparently so grave that contemporary records were erased or destroyed. Some scribes suggest this was a deliberate act, to prevent panic or misuse of knowledge. The identity of the threat — cult, creature, or device — remains unknown.”_
