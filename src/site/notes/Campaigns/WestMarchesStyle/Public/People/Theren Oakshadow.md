# **Theren Oakshadow**

![Theren_Oakshadow.jpg](/img/user/_assets/WestMarchesStyle/NPC%20Portraits/Theren_Oakshadow.jpg)

Theren Oakshadow serves as a field operative and investigator for the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]], known for his discretion and quiet efficiency. Operating from a hidden ranger lodge near the **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/High Moor\|High Moor]]**, Oakshadow monitors ecological stability, tracks poachers and smugglers, and reports on arcane disturbances that threaten natural balance. His work rarely draws attention — by design.

## Observed Activity

Oakshadow often operates independently, relying on long-range patrols and local contacts to gather intelligence. He is particularly vigilant in regions where industrial expansion or magical experimentation risk ecological collapse. When corruption of nature or planar interference is detected, he coordinates subtle countermeasures — typically through misinformation, sabotage, or the redirection of more overt Enclave forces.

## Assessment

Oakshadow is regarded as disciplined, analytical, and cautious to a fault. His preference for observation over intervention has earned both respect and frustration among his peers. While rarely seen in the open, his reports and covert actions have prevented several ecological crises before they began — making him one of the Enclave’s most effective, if least recognized, operatives.
