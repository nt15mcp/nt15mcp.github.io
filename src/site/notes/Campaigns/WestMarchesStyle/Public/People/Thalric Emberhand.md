Known for his bravery during the _Ashvale Dragon Raid_, **Thalric Emberhand** remains a symbol of the Codex’s field tradition — courage tempered by restraint. When the dragon’s flames consumed the town, Thalric redirected the inferno through rune-bound conduits, saving countless lives and preserving vital lore.

### Legacy

A rune-forged gauntlet, said to bear the last embers of that fateful battle, rests in the Hall of Witness. Members often place their hands upon it before undertaking dangerous missions — a silent pledge to act with courage and care.
