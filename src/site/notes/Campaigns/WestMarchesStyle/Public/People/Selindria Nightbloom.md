## Assessment

While her schemes are subtle and often hidden, her influence within the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Obsidian Choir\|Obsidian Choir]] is significant, shaping the group’s research priorities and arcane strategies. Players encountering her are likely to face intricate plots and carefully concealed agendas rather than direct confrontation.
