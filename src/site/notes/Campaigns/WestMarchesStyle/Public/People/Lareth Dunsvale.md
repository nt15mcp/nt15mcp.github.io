Once a humble envoy turned peacemaker, **Lareth Dunsvale** is remembered as one of the most diplomatic minds ever to serve the Order. His calm resolve and command of nuance brought an end to the _Border Concord Wars_, an achievement that still serves as a case study in the Codex’s annals on negotiation and moral equilibrium.

### Contributions to the Codex

Dunsvale authored the _Treatise on Concordant Histories_, a foundational volume detailing the ethical limits of mediation and the dangers of overreach in mortal affairs. His field reports became a blueprint for modern Codex envoys, blending political insight with the Order’s guiding doctrine of balance.

### Legacy

Though decades have passed since his final mission, his methods remain core to the Codex’s diplomatic training. The Dunsvale Lectures — held annually in the Chapter Hall — honor his approach to “peace through perspective.”
