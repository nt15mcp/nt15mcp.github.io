## **Serenya Moonscribe**

![Serenya_Moonscribe.jpg](/img/user/_assets/WestMarchesStyle/NPC%20Portraits/Serenya_Moonscribe.jpg)

**Serenya Moonscribe** stands among the Order’s most inventive chroniclers — equal parts scholar and artisan. Her luminous _arcane-lanterns_ revolutionized field documentation, allowing explorers to transcribe magical phenomena safely under unstable planar light.

### Contributions to the Codex

Moonscribe devised the first standardized **Arcane Phenomena Record (APR)** format, ensuring that observations of magical events could be cross-referenced without temporal distortion. Her research shaped the Codex’s preservation wards still in use today.

### Legacy

Her journals, bound in moonlight-treated vellum, continue to circulate among senior archivists. Each copy glows faintly under starlight — a tribute to the woman who illuminated both knowledge and the paths to find it.
