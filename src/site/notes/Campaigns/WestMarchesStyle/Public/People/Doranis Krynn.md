## Assessment

Krynn exemplifies the Choir’s doctrine of disciplined brutality — a commander whose intellect is matched by his capacity for ruthless efficiency. Though unwaveringly loyal to Thayan leadership, his personal ambition and authoritarian temperament often create friction within the organization. His influence is felt most acutely in the fear he instills — both among his subordinates and his enemies.
