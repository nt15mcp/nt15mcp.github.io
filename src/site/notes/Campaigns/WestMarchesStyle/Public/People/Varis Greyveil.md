## **Varis Greyveil**

![Varis Greyveil.jpg](/img/user/_assets/WestMarchesStyle/NPC%20Portraits/Varis%20Greyveil.jpg)

Philosopher, administrator, and architect of order itself — **Varis Greyveil** was the quiet hand that gave the Codex structure. His analytical mind transformed scattered reports into a cohesive archival system, enabling centuries of cumulative wisdom to endure unbroken.

### Contributions to the Codex

Greyveil’s _Doctrine of Interlinked Records_ established the methodical classification now known as the Greyveil Index. His political treatises later guided the Order’s dealings with ruling bodies, ensuring the Codex’s neutrality without forfeiting influence.

### Legacy

Though reclusive in life, Greyveil’s organizational framework remains the invisible spine of the Order. To this day, archivists invoke “Greyveil’s Law” — _that knowledge unstructured is knowledge already lost._
