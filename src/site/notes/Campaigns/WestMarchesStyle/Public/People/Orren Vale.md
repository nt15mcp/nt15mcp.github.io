# **Orren Vale**

![Orren_Vale.jpg](/img/user/_assets/WestMarchesStyle/NPC%20Portraits/Orren_Vale.jpg)

Orren Vale is recognized by the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Crimson Hand Consortium\|Crimson Hand Consortium]] as an eccentric gnome specializing in arcane and alchemical experimentation. He operates from a concealed laboratory in [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]]’s undercity, developing devices and substances that the Consortium can use for intelligence gathering, smuggling, and operational leverage.

- Occasional collaboration with external buyers, including minor factions and opportunistic merchants.
