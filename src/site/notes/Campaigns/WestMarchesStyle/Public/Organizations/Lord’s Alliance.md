# **Lord’s Alliance**

The **Lord’s Alliance** is a coalition of city-states and influential leaders dedicated to maintaining regional stability, fostering political cooperation, and securing economic prosperity. Its members view wealth, trade, and structured governance as essential engines of civilization and societal order.

Ambitious and pragmatic, the Alliance relies on its extensive network of wealthy members, city militias, fortified strongholds, and diplomatic contacts to enforce laws and uphold agreements between settlements. Trade corridors are protected, cities are patrolled, and targeted measures are used to ensure compliance and cooperation across their sphere of influence.

While focused on stability and commerce, the Alliance’s efforts sometimes put it at odds with clandestine or disruptive factions, such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Crimson Hand Consortium\|Crimson Hand Consortium]], whose ambitions can interfere with established order and trade. Allies like the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] often complement the Alliance’s goals, supporting its pursuit of a cohesive and secure region.

Recognized as a centralizing force in regional politics, the Lord’s Alliance is synonymous with organized governance, economic oversight, and the careful management of civic power.
