# **Zhentarim**

The **Zhentarim** is a powerful and shadowy organization that pursues wealth and influence across the region through commerce, mercenary operations, and covert power. Members of the Zhentarim are ambitious, ruthless, and highly opportunistic, adept at leveraging networks of spies, mercenaries, and black-market contacts to achieve their goals.

The organization seeks to expand control over trade routes, mercenary companies, and political connections, often using bribery, extortion, espionage, and strategic manipulation to secure advantage. While their operations are frequently discreet, the effects of their influence are felt throughout cities and settlements, where control over commerce and information can tip the balance of power.

Though alliances with other factions are formed opportunistically and often temporary, the Zhentarim frequently find themselves at odds with groups like the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]], whose missions or moral frameworks conflict with the organizationâ€™s pursuit of profit and strategic influence.

Recognized for cunning, resourcefulness, and a pervasive presence in regional commerce and politics, the Zhentarim operate in the shadows, shaping trade, power, and opportunity according to their own designs.
