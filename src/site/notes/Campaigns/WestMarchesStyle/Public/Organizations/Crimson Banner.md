# **Crimson Banner**

**Motto:** *“Strength in vigilance.”*

The **Crimson Banner** is a renowned military organization responsible for safeguarding settlements and trade routes along the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]]. Its members are known for their discipline, boldness, and unwavering loyalty to the regions under their protection. Soldiers of the Banner are often seen training in the open fields outside their garrisons, maintaining patrols along borders, or overseeing the construction of fortifications meant to secure towns and key passages.

The Banner has earned a reputation as a force both dependable and formidable. While their presence reassures local communities, their strict adherence to order and procedure sometimes places them at odds with merchant guilds and more independent groups. Within the organization, hierarchy and training are paramount; officers are chosen for their strategic acumen, and soldiers take pride in their skill and reliability.

Though militaristic in nature, the Crimson Banner is not merely a hammer. Their scouts, patrols, and logistical networks reflect careful planning and coordination, ensuring that the Banner can respond efficiently to threats without unnecessary disruption to everyday life. Alliances with groups such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] bolster their capacity to maintain regional safety, though their methods and priorities occasionally put them in tension with less organized or more opportunistic factions, including certain mercantile interests and the enigmatic [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]].

The Crimson Banner is recognized throughout the region as a symbol of steadfast protection and military precision — a body whose presence is as much about reassurance as it is about force.
