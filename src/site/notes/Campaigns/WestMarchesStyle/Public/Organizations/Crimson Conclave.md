### **Crimson Conclave**

The **Crimson Conclave** functions as the diplomatic and political arm of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Red Wizards of Thay\|Red Wizards of Thay]]. Its emissaries negotiate pacts, trade rights, and magical contracts with foreign powers, cloaking Thayan ambitions in the guise of cooperation.

While its agents operate in public more frequently than other Thayan groups, their true objectives often include the acquisition of arcane secrets, relics, or leverage over local leaders. The Conclave’s work ensures Thay’s continued influence across the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]] and beyond, often without a single spell being cast.
