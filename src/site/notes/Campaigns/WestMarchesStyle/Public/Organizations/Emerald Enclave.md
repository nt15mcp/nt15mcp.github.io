# **Emerald Enclave**

The **Emerald Enclave** is a loose but organized coalition devoted to preserving the balance between civilization and the natural world. Its members, often [[druids\|druids]] and [[rangers\|rangers]], are deeply attuned to the rhythms of the land, and they work to prevent ecological disruption and the reckless exploitation of natural resources.

The Enclave approaches its mission with patience and a measured hand. Its methods range from ritualistic interventions at sacred sites to environmental management and diplomacy with local communities. Magical wards, knowledge of planar and natural forces, and expert tracking are tools the Enclave uses to safeguard forests, rivers, and other vulnerable ecosystems.

While generally idealistic and calm in demeanor, the Enclave can appear aloof or detached from human affairs, focusing on the long-term health of the world rather than immediate political concerns. They maintain alliances with groups like the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]], who share their interest in protecting free peoples and natural balance, though conflicts occasionally arise with other organizations, including the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]], [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Iron Sigil\|Iron Sigil]], and even the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] when expansion or exploitation threatens the environment.

The Emerald Enclave is recognized as a guardian of the natural world, its influence subtle yet enduring, preserving areas of ecological and magical significance across the region.
