# **Red Wizards of Thay**

The **Red Wizards of Thay** are an enigmatic and highly skilled organization devoted to the study and mastery of arcane power. Renowned for their ambition and intellectual rigor, they seek to acquire and control magical knowledge, often pursuing research and experimentation that others might consider dangerous or forbidden.

Members of the Red Wizards are typically secretive, obsessive, and highly confident in their abilities. They maintain extensive networks of magical scholars, planar research facilities, constructs, and arcane artifacts, enabling them to conduct experiments, develop powerful magical tools, and explore the boundaries of known magic. Their work is meticulous and disciplined, though sometimes bordering on extreme risk-taking in the pursuit of discovery and influence.

The organization is structured into specialized divisions known as _sub-orders_, each devoted to a distinct aspect of Thayan ambition. Among the most prominent are the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Obsidian Choir\|Obsidian Choir]], dedicated to experimental research and planar studies; the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Crimson Conclave\|Crimson Conclave]], which manages diplomacy and external relations; and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Ashen Blades\|Ashen Blades]], who enforce Thayan will through martial and arcane strength.

While the organization occasionally forms opportunistic alliances with groups such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] or even the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]], their methods and ambitions frequently bring them into tension with other factions, including the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]], whose priorities or ethical frameworks can conflict with the Red Wizards’ pursuits.

The Red Wizards of Thay are recognized as formidable practitioners of magic, combining secrecy, ambition, and scholarly precision to extend their influence and advance the understanding — and control — of arcane forces.
