# **Order of the Gauntlet**

The **Order of the Gauntlet** is a disciplined organization dedicated to combating evil, protecting the innocent, and upholding law and order throughout the region. Known for their bravery and unwavering sense of duty, members of the Order often embody the highest standards of martial and moral discipline.

[[Knights\|Knights]], [[clerics\|clerics]], and other devoted agents form the backbone of the organization, supported by fortified strongholds and extensive intelligence networks. Their methods include patrolling threatened areas, directly confronting dangers, escorting vulnerable parties, and carrying out judicial enforcement where necessary. The Order values courage, precision, and adherence to established codes of conduct, though their rigid approach can sometimes appear inflexible or overly zealous.

The Order frequently works alongside allies such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]], coordinating efforts to maintain regional security and justice.

Recognized as stalwart defenders of law and principle, the Order of the Gauntlet is a symbol of protection, moral certainty, and unwavering vigilance against threats to the innocent.
