# **Harpers**

The **Harpers** are a secretive network devoted to preserving knowledge, promoting justice, and maintaining balance across political and magical spheres. Though their methods are often subtle and unseen, the organization is widely respected for its intelligence and careful guidance of regional affairs.

Members of the Harpers are typically idealistic and morally principled, yet flexible when circumstances demand discretion or compromise. Field agents, spies, and scholars work together to gather intelligence, monitor influential figures, and prevent the misuse of power, while their libraries and magical resources support the careful study of arcane and historical knowledge.

The organization often collaborates with groups that share similar goals, such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]], leveraging alliances to advance stability and safeguard communities. However, their activities can place them at odds with more overtly aggressive or opportunistic factions, including the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Red Wizards of Thay\|Red Wizards of Thay]], whose ambitions sometimes threaten the balance the Harpers strive to protect.

The Harpers are recognized not for martial might but for subtle influence and strategic insight, acting as unseen stewards of knowledge and guardians against tyranny throughout the region.
