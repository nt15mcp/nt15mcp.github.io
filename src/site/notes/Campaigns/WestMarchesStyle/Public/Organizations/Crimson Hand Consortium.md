# **Crimson Hand Consortium**

The **Crimson Hand Consortium** is a network of influential operatives and [[merchants\|merchants]] who operate largely in the shadows, pursuing profit and power through calculated, often discreet, means. Members of the Consortium are known for their cunning and adaptability, able to navigate the shifting allegiances and rivalries of the [[Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]] with subtlety and precision.

While the Consortium’s activities are rarely publicized, whispers of their involvement in trade disputes, clandestine contracts, and the occasional sabotage have made their reputation as a quietly formidable presence. They maintain extensive networks of spies, mercenaries, and hidden safehouses, enabling them to influence events far beyond the reach of ordinary observers. 

The organization thrives on opportunism, forming temporary alliances when it suits their aims — whether with the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]], local [[merchant lords\|merchant lords]], or other ambitious [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/_Index\|factions]] — but their loyalty is always to the Consortium itself. Rivalries exist with more principled or overtly protective groups, such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Dawnforged Circle\|Dawnforged Circle]] or the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]], whose operations sometimes intersect with the Consortium’s clandestine interests.

The Crimson Hand Consortium is recognized less for displays of force than for its subtle, persistent influence. To many, they are the unseen hand shaping commerce, politics, and clandestine affairs across the region.
