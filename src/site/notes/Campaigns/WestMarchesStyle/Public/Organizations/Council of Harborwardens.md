# **Council of Harborwardens**

The **Councils of Harborwardens** are regional governing bodies established in major coastal towns along the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]]. Each council oversees maritime trade, infrastructure, and civic administration within its harbor city, balancing the interests of merchants, artisans, and seafarers.

Though the councils operate independently, their structure and traditions share a common origin — born from early trade accords among Sword Coast port towns seeking to regulate commerce and ensure safe passage between settlements.

## Regional Variations

### **Grayharbor Council of Harborwardens**

The council of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] emphasizes _transparency and civic engagement_. Meetings are held publicly at the waterfront, and citizens are encouraged to attend or petition the wardens directly. It is known for its relatively open governance and close cooperation with the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Harpers\|Harpers]] in maintaining civic balance.

### **Rivensport Council of Harborwardens**

In contrast, [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Rivensport\|Rivensport]]’s council is more _commercially driven_, dominated by merchant guilds and trade syndicates. It maintains strong ties to the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Iron Sigil\|Iron Sigil]], prioritizing economic expansion, shipbuilding, and trade route control. Decisions are efficient but often politically charged, with rumors of backroom agreements and private negotiations being commonplace.

## Intercouncil Relations

Although no formal confederation binds the councils together, informal cooperation exists — especially concerning piracy, navigation law, and trade tariffs. Disputes are typically mediated by envoys from neutral ports or Alliance arbiters.

Some scholars note that, collectively, the Harborwardens hold as much soft power over [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]] commerce as any major noble house or mercantile faction.
