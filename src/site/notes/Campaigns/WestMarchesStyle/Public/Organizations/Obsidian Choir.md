### **Obsidian Choir**

The **Obsidian Choir** serves as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Red Wizards of Thay\|Red Wizards]]’ foremost division of arcane research and experimentation. Its members specialize in planar studies, magical weaponization, and soulcrafting — often operating at the edge of what even Thayan law allows.

Choir laboratories are heavily warded and remote, accessible only to sanctioned researchers and their enforcers. Rumors persist of living spells, bound entities, and weaponized enchantments developed under its authority.

The Choir’s influence extends beyond Thay through discreet trade in rare magical materials and occasional collaboration with the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] or other factions willing to fund their work.
