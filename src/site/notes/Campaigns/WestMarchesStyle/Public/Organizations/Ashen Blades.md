### **Ashen Blades**

The **Ashen Blades** represent the militant enforcement wing of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Red Wizards of Thay\|Red Wizards of Thay]], responsible for artifact retrieval, security, and suppression of rogue mages. Composed of battle-trained wizards, war constructs, and mercenary spellblades, the Blades operate where diplomacy and research fail.

They are feared for their precision and efficiency — and for their willingness to burn entire ruins or settlements rather than let Thayan secrets fall into foreign hands. While officially subordinate to Thay’s ruling magocracy, the Ashen Blades often answer only to their own command structure in the field.
