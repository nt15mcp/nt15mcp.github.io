# 🌿 Rumors & Leads

> *“Every whisper holds a seed of truth.”*

These are unverified reports, anomalies, or curiosities awaiting investigation.  
Members of the Order may **sign their characters up** to pursue any available lead.  
Once an expedition is formed, the rumor is moved to [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Active Missions\|Active Missions]].
