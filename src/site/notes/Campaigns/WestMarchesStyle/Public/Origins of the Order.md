## **Origins of the Order**

> _“The first entry in the Codex is lost to time; what remains are fragments, rumors, and the whispered memories of those who came before.”_  
> — Anonymous Scholar, c. 237 years ago

The Order of the Seventh Codex has existed for centuries, yet its beginnings remain shrouded in uncertainty. Surviving records are incomplete, and many early Codex entries are cryptic. Scholars and chroniclers have pieced together a number of stories — some likely true, others embellished — but none offer definitive answers.

Below are the most frequently cited accounts, as recorded in the archives of the Grayharbor Chapter.

### **1. The Cataclysm That Wasn’t**

> _“Some scholars recount that a magical experiment once threatened to destroy an entire city. Though disaster was narrowly avoided, the founders were moved to form a guild capable of monitoring such dangers. Details vary, and many of the original Codex entries have been lost.”_  
> — Elder Archivist, Grayharbor

Fragments suggest that vigilance and early intervention were central to this origin. The record is sparse, but surviving notes hint at the founders’ concern with threats that ordinary authorities could neither foresee nor contain.

### **2. The Scholars’ Pact**

> _“In certain northern archives, one finds mention of a secret circle of scholars and adventurers who sought to preserve knowledge of arcane phenomena and dangerous creatures. They feared the loss of knowledge to time, neglect, or misuse. Many entries are poetic, lamenting the fragility of memory.”_  
> — Chronicler of the Western Coast

Some historians believe that the careful cataloging of discoveries — the Codex itself — was the original mission, with fieldwork emerging later as necessity dictated.

### **3. The Mercenary Turned Mentor**

> _“A celebrated adventurer, known in taverns and tales alike, once counseled that ordinary forces caused more chaos than good when facing the unknown. Trusted companions reportedly helped him organize a more systematic approach. Thus, some argue, the Order’s practical, field-oriented work has roots in this individual’s vision.”_  
> — Memoirs of the Grayharbor Chapter

Accounts of this origin emphasize action and preparedness as much as scholarship, though precise details of the legendary figure’s deeds are difficult to verify.

### **4. The Forgotten Threat**

> _“Several early Codex fragments allude to a danger now lost to memory, one apparently so grave that contemporary records were erased or destroyed. Some scribes suggest this was a deliberate act, to prevent panic or misuse of knowledge. The identity of the threat — cult, creature, or device — remains unknown.”_  
> — Archivist’s Marginalia, Codex Fragment #7

This origin emphasizes secrecy and caution, perhaps more than the others. Even now, whispers of the Forgotten Threat circulate in Grayharbor’s halls, though no definitive evidence remains.

### **A Layered Legacy**

> _“As with many ancient matters, truth is rarely simple. Each fragment, each rumor, contributes to a larger tapestry. The Order’s beginnings may well have combined vigilance, scholarship, practical action, and secrecy — but the exact pattern is lost to time.”_  
> — Senior Archivist, Grayharbor Hall
