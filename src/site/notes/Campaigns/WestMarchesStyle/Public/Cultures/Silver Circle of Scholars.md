## **Silver Circle of Scholars**

The **Silver Circle of Scholars** is a learned culture of mages, sages, and arcane researchers dedicated to the careful study and ethical application of magic. Members value intellectual rigor, debate, and preservation of knowledge, often collaborating across regions to maintain libraries, academies, and magical archives. While not directly involved in political affairs, their research indirectly influences rulers, guilds, and adventuring parties seeking magical guidance.
