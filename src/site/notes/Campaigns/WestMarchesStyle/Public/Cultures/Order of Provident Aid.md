## **Order of Provident Aid**

The **Order of Provident Aid** is a non-political, humanitarian culture focused on relief, healing, and charitable work across the region. Unlike factions such as the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] or [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]], the Order does not engage in governance or military operations. Its members, including healers, caregivers, and traveling clerics, provide aid to impoverished towns, refugee camps, and disaster-stricken areas.

- **Activities:** Food distribution, medical care, temporary housing, and moral instruction.
    
- **Structure:** Organized loosely into local chapters; emphasis on practical service over hierarchy.
    
- **Influence:** Cultural and social rather than political, shaping public opinion and community resilience.
    
- **Reputation:** Highly respected among common folk; considered neutral and benevolent by most factions.
