# **Merchant Lords**

The **Merchant Lords** are not a formal organization, but a social and economic class composed of wealthy traders, guild leaders, and entrepreneurs who wield significant influence across cities and trade hubs. Their presence shapes the rhythm of commerce, the development of infrastructure, and the priorities of urban governance.

Known for their pragmatism, ambition, and shrewd understanding of markets, Merchant Lords maintain extensive trading networks, invest in infrastructure, and guide the economic policies of the regions they influence. Their decisions can determine the prosperity of towns, the stability of trade routes, and the success of emerging enterprises.

While their influence generally fosters economic growth, their priorities sometimes conflict with other interests â€” such as environmental concerns, local craftsmen, or factions that disrupt trade. Still, they are widely recognized as pivotal figures in regional commerce, driving both innovation and prosperity through skillful management of wealth and networks.

Merchant Lords serve as patrons, investors, and arbiters of the economic landscape, their impact felt across cities, ports, and marketplaces alike.
