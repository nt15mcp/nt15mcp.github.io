# **The Vanishing Hamlet** – _Level 2–4_  
A small coastal hamlet has vanished into a planar rift. Faint voices and glimpses of the missing villagers can be seen through the shimmering anomaly, but the phenomenon is unstable and growing. The Order calls a team to enter the rift, stabilize the anomaly, and rescue any inhabitants before nearby settlements are threatened. The mission will test courage, resourcefulness, and teamwork under life-or-death conditions.
