### **Mirror of Still Currents**

**Item Type:** Constructed Artifact  
**Form:** A circular mirror framed in silvery stone, its surface perpetually rippling as though reflecting unseen tides. When attuned to an ambient magical signal, the mirror begins to hum faintly and distort nearby light.

**Known Properties:**  
When placed within range of linked or communicating constructs, arcane relays, or planar message systems, the mirror produces interference patterns that confuse or desynchronize them. Its effect scales with proximity: small at a distance, but capable of completely severing synchronization between networked magical sources when placed at a central nexus point. The mirror was locked away after it disrupted several of the Orderâ€™s own containment wards during testing.
