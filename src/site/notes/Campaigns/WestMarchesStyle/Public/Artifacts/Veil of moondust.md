### **Veil of Moondust**

**Item Type:** Ethereal Cloth  
**Form:** A gossamer sheet that catches no light and leaves no shadow.

**Known Properties:**  
When cast over an area or individual, all sound within becomes distorted, as if muffled by distance. Those beneath the veil appear invisible to scrying or dream-sight but are said to draw the attention of celestial watchers when used for deceit.
