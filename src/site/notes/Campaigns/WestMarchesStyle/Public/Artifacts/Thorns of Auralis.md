### **Thorns of Auralis**

**Item Type:** Botanical Remnant  
**Form:** A bundle of crystalline thorns bound by faded silk.

**Known Properties:**  
When buried, the thorns cause rapid overgrowth â€” an explosion of flora consuming all within reach. The resulting vegetation resists fire, frost, and decay, yet withers if exposed to blood.
