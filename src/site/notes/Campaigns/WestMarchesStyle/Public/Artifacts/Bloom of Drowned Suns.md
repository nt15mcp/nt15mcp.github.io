### **The Bloom of Drowned Suns**

**Item Type:** Contained Phenomenon  
**Form:** A sealed glass sphere containing a single luminous flower that drifts in suspended water.

**Known Properties:**  
When unsealed, the bloom unfolds and releases sunlight underwater or in total darkness, creating an artificial dawn. If left open too long, it begins to invert â€” drawing light inward, leaving only endless night.
