### **Ember Crucible**

**Item Type:** Arcane Vessel  
**Form:** A heavy, blackened chalice of etched brass and fused volcanic glass. When dormant, it is cool to the touch; when exposed to open flame, faint golden veins pulse across its surface.

**Known Properties:**  
When filled with flame — mundane or magical — the Crucible draws it inward, storing the heat and light without smoke or damage to the vessel. The stored fire may be released at will, but emerges as gentle radiance rather than destructive blaze. The Order noted that the Crucible could transform wildfire energy into something life-sustaining for a short duration, encouraging rapid regrowth in scorched terrain.
