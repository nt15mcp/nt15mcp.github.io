### **Glass Serpent**

**Item Type:** Living Relic  
**Form:** A sinuous sculpture of translucent crystal, constantly shifting between solid and liquid states. Its eyes glow faintly when it senses nearby motion.

**Known Properties:**  
The serpent absorbs ambient kinetic energy, stilling movement in its vicinity. Objects in motion slow to a crawl; voices sound stretched and warped. When agitated, it releases this stored energy in a single, devastating pulse capable of shattering stone.
