### **Wyrd Compass**

**Item Type:** Navigational Device  
**Form:** A compass of tarnished silver whose needle spins wildly until held near a source of destiny-altering magic.

**Known Properties:**  
Rather than point north, the needle aligns toward “convergence points” — places where fate bends sharply. The Order used it sparingly, for its path often led directly into calamity.
