### **Obsidian Chalice**

**Item Type:** Ritual Vessel  
**Form:** A cup carved from pure obsidian, its rim traced with etched constellations.

**Known Properties:**  
Liquids poured within the chalice gain properties of clarity and truth — poisons turn harmless, illusions vanish, and lies spoken nearby become painful to utter. Yet those who drink from it too often begin to see through more than deceptions — through skin, walls, and sanity alike.
