### **Reliquary of Quiet Earth**

**Item Type:** Sealed Reliquary  
**Form:** A stone coffer carved from pale shale, its lid bound by root-like inlays of lead and bone. When opened, faint ash-like motes drift upward and vanish before touching air.

**Known Properties:**  
The reliquary exerts a pacifying field over necrotic energies. Within a radius of several dozen paces, undead and lingering death-magic weaken and fall inert. The field does not destroy such energies â€” it merely compels them to rest. Prolonged use leaves soil enriched but strangely silent for years afterward.
