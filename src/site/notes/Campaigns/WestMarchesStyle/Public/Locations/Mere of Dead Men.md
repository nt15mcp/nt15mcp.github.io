# **Mere of Dead Men**

The Mere of Dead Men is a large, marshy expanse located south of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Stonebark Keep\|Stonebark Keep]]. Known for its treacherous bogs, mist-shrouded waters, and scattered ruins, it serves as both a natural barrier and a region of ecological significance. The area is patrolled by members of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Politics/Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] to maintain balance and prevent exploitation, while local communities navigate its waters for fishing, foraging, and cautious trade.
