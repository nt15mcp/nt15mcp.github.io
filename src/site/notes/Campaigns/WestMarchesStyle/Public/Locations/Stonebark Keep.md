# **Stonebark Keep**

Stonebark Keep is a hidden fortress entwined with ancient trees, located north of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Mere of Dead Men\|Mere of Dead Men]]. Serving as both a stronghold and sanctuary, it houses druids, rangers, and guardians of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Politics/Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]]. The keep is designed to blend seamlessly into its natural surroundings, with watch posts, defensive wards, and living quarters integrated into the forest canopy. It acts as a base of operations for the protection of sacred groves and enforcement of druidic law.
