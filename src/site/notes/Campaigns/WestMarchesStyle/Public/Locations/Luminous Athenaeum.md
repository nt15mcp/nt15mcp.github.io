## **Luminous Athenaeum**

The **Luminous Athenaeum** is a grand library-temple in [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Athkatla\|Athkatla]], combining divine architecture with arcane wards. Known for its extensive collections of scrolls, tomes, and magical artifacts, it serves as a center of learning for the **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Cultures/Silver Circle of Scholars\|Silver Circle of Scholars]]** and the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Dawnforged Circle\|Dawnforged Circle]]. Scholars and mages travel from distant regions to study, and the Athenaeum also functions as a sanctuary for research in protective and healing magic.
