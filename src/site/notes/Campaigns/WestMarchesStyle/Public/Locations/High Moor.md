# **High Moor**

The High Moor is a vast, windswept expanse of rugged hills, peat bogs, and ancient standing stones stretching southeast of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Iriaebor\|Iriaebor]]. Once the site of elven forests and human kingdoms, it is now a desolate wilderness scarred by centuries of magical upheaval and war. Dangerous beasts, wandering undead, and unpredictable storms make travel perilous.

Despite its harshness, the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] maintains hidden lodges and waystations throughout the region, safeguarding its fragile ecosystems and monitoring remnants of unstable magic that still linger beneath the soil.
