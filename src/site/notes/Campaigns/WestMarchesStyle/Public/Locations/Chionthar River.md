## **Chionthar River**

The **Chionthar River** flows eastward from the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Misty Forest\|Misty Forest]] through fertile lowlands before joining the western delta near [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Berdusk\|Berdusk]]. Its waters are wide and generally slow-moving, supporting both agriculture and riverine trade for surrounding communities. Pilgrims, merchants, and traveling missionaries like [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/People/Sister Lyrielle Dawnmantle\|Sister Lyrielle Dawnmantle]] frequently use its banks for travel and temporary settlements. The river also acts as a natural boundary, with marshes and small tributaries forming protective buffers for nearby villages.
