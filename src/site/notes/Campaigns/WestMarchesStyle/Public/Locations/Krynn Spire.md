## Description

Krynn Spire rises from a jagged outcrop of volcanic rock, its surface etched with ancient runes that pulse when approached. Within, vast laboratories, binding chambers, and scriptoriums hum with arcane energy. Rumors persist of sealed lower levels devoted to planar experimentation and creature containment.

## Reputation

Among scholars and rival factions, Krynn Spire is whispered to be both a fortress and a prison — a place where dangerous research is conducted far from oversight. Few who visit are granted full access, and fewer still speak openly of what they witness within.
