## **High Forest**

The **High Forest** is a vast, ancient woodland located in the northern heartlands of the region, stretching for hundreds of miles across hills, rivers, and hidden valleys. Known for its towering oaks, dense undergrowth, and pockets of untamed magic, it serves as a critical refuge for wildlife, mystical creatures, and secluded communities.

The forest is home to numerous druidic circles, including leaders of the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Organizations/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]], who patrol its depths to maintain ecological and magical balance. Travelers and adventurers are advised to respect local customs and natural landmarks, as getting lost or offending the forestâ€™s guardians can have dangerous consequences.

The High Forest also contains ruins of long-forgotten civilizations, enchanted glades, and ley-line nodes that attract scholars, spellcasters, and those seeking rare resources. It acts as both a natural barrier against northern threats and a critical source of magical and mundane resources for nearby settlements.
