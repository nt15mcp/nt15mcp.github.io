## **Verdant Hills**

The **Verdant Hills** are gently rolling farmlands and pasturelands located north of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Farrowind Homestead\|Farrowind Homestead]]. Known for their fertile soil and abundant freshwater streams, the region supports a mix of subsistence farming, orchards, and grazing livestock. Small villages and scattered homesteads dot the landscape, and traveling merchants often pass through, bringing trade and news. The area is lightly patrolled by [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Politics/Factions/Verdant Enclave\|Verdant Enclave]] representatives to encourage sustainable land use and protect local farmers from banditry.
