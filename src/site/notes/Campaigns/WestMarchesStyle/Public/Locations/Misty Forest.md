# **Misty Forest**

The **Misty Forest** is an expansive, fog-laden woodland along the northern borders of the Crimson Bannerâ€™s territory. Towering old-growth trees, thick underbrush, and near-constant mist create natural concealment, making the forest ideal for scouts, rangers, and covert operations. The forest is patrolled by the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Politics/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]] and allied [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Politics/Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] operatives to monitor border threats and maintain territorial security. Local communities traverse its hidden paths for hunting, foraging, and cautious trade.
