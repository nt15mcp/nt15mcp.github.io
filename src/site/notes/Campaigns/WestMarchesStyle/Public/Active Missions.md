# Active Missions

> *“The field is the truest teacher.”*

Here are ongoing investigations currently undertaken by members of the Order.
Members of the Order may **sign up** to complete any available mission in the Discord Lodge.
When a mission concludes, its report is filed as a new [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/_Index\|Codex Entry]].
