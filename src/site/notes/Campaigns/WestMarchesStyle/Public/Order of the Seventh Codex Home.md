## 🌌 **Order of the Seventh Codex**

> _“Identify. Address. Preserve.”_  
> — Motto of the Order

---

### 🏛️ **Charter**

**The Order of the Seventh Codex exists to identify and address unusual or dangerous disturbances before they escalate.**

Our mission is threefold:

1. **Identify** anomalies, rumors, and unexplained phenomena.
    
2. **Address** threats efficiently, stabilizing situations before they worsen.
    
3. **Preserve** discoveries in the Codex, safeguarding the future.
    

The Order acts not for glory, judgment, or dominion — but for vigilance, understanding, and preservation.

---

### 📖 **The Grayharbor Chapter**

Headquartered in **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]]**, south of **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]]**, this chapter serves as the central hub of the **Order of the Seventh Codex** along the western coast.

From this hall, members of the Order work tirelessly to trace the threads of the strange and the extraordinary — charting phenomena that others might dismiss as myth, misfortune, or madness.

### **Order Operations**

Within the vaulted chambers of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]], daily life revolves around three core duties:

- **Reviewing [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Rumors & Leads\|Rumors & Leads]]**  
    Whispers from sailors, travelers, dreamers, and distant scholars filter constantly into the Hall. These accounts — _Rumors_ — are fragments of potential anomalies or supernatural disturbances.  
    Field parties are occasionally dispatched to _investigate_ these tales and determine whether they represent genuine threats, benign curiosities, or mere coincidence.  
    A Rumor may prove nothing at all… or be the first tremor of something catastrophic.
    
- **Undertaking [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Active Missions\|Jobs & Missions]]**  
    When a situation has already been verified as dangerous, unstable, or clearly anomalous, it becomes a _Mission_.  
    These operations focus on **containment, resolution, or prevention** — acting before an incident escalates beyond control.  
    Some Missions are simple: close a tear, calm a restless haunt, retrieve a lost relic. Others unravel into sprawling calamities that alter the course of entire regions.
    
- **Recording Codex Entries**  
    Findings from both Rumors and Missions are submitted as **Codex Entries** — written accounts, maps, and arcane annotations preserved for future generations of the Order.  
    Each entry ensures that knowledge, once won, will not be lost again.

### 🧭 **How to Join**

> _“Curiosity is the first qualification.”_

Those who wish to serve need not petition kings or gods.  
They need only bring an open mind, a steady hand, and the willingness to record the truth.

To become a field member of the Order, **apply within** —  
the archivists of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] maintain a watchful eye for capable volunteers.  
(For out-of-character coordination, all inquiries are handled through the **Discord Lodge**.)

---

### 📘 **The Codex**

All field operations are logged as official **Codex Entries** — structured reports filed by those who undertake expeditions.

Each record preserves the facts of a mission: what was found, how it was handled, and what the world learned (or failed to learn) as a result.

See:

- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/_Index\|Codex Entries]] — completed records
    
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Rumors & Leads\|Rumors & Leads]] — reports to investigate
	
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Active Missions\|Active Missions]] — jobs available
    
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Artifacts/_Index\|Recovered Artifacts & Phenomena]] — notable finds and objects

### ✍️ **Field Reporting Template**

When submitting a report to the Codex, use the **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/Codex Entry Template\|Codex Entry Template]]**

> _The Codex does not judge success or failure — only what was observed, recorded, and learned._

---

### 🧩 **Ranks of the Order**

Ranks serve as **honorary titles**, reflecting dedication to the mission — not authority over others.

| 2    | **Initiate**      |

> _All ranks are ceremonial within the [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] Chapter. Every member may undertake missions, provided they record what they find._

### 🕯️ **Traditions of the Order**

- **The Marking of Discovery** — Every completed mission earns a new Codex entry.
