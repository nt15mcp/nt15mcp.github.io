## 🌌 **Order of the Seventh Codex**

> _“Identify. Address. Preserve.”_  
> — Motto of the Order

---

### 🏛️ **Charter**

**The Order of the Seventh Codex exists to identify and address unusual or dangerous disturbances before they escalate.**

Our mission is threefold:

1. **Identify** anomalies, rumors, and unexplained phenomena.
    
2. **Address** threats efficiently, stabilizing situations before they worsen.
    
3. **Preserve** discoveries in the Codex, safeguarding the future.
    

The Order acts not for glory, judgment, or dominion — but for vigilance, understanding, and preservation.

### 📖 **The [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] Chapter**

> _“Where the seas meet the shelves of knowledge.”_

Headquartered in **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]]**, south of Candlekeep, this chapter serves as the **central hub** of Order operations along the western coast.

From this hall, members of the Order:

- Review **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Rumors & Leads\|Rumors & Leads]]** drawn from travelers, scholars, and dreamers alike.
    
- Form temporary **Field Parties** to investigate pressing anomalies.
    
- Submit reports to be recorded as **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/Index\|Codex Entries]]** for future generations.
    

The [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] Hall hums with quiet purpose — scholars, veterans, and explorers alike trading rumor, ink, and ale.

### 🧭 **How to Join**

> _“Curiosity is the first qualification.”_

Those who wish to serve need not petition kings or gods.  
They need only bring an open mind, a steady hand, and the willingness to record the truth.

To become a field member of the Order, **apply within** —  
the archivists of [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Locations/Grayharbor\|Grayharbor]] maintain a watchful eye for capable volunteers.  
(For out-of-character coordination, all inquiries are handled through the **Discord Lodge**.)

---

### 📘 **The Codex**

All field operations are logged as official **Codex Entries** — structured reports filed by those who undertake expeditions.

Each record preserves the facts of a mission: what was found, how it was handled, and what the world learned (or failed to learn) as a result.

See:

- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/Index\|Codex Entries]] — completed records
    
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Rumors & Leads\|Rumors & Leads]] — ongoing investigations
	
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Active Missions\|Active Missions]] — jobs available
    
- [[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Artifacts/Index\|Recovered Artifacts & Phenomena]] — notable finds and objects

### ✍️ **Field Reporting Template**

When submitting a report to the Codex, use the **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/Codex-Entries/Codex Entry Template\|Codex Entry Template]]**

> _The Codex does not judge success or failure — only what was observed, recorded, and learned._

---

### 🧩 **Ranks of the Order**

Ranks serve as **honorary titles**, reflecting dedication to the mission — not authority over others.
