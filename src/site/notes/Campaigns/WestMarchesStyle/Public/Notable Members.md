## **Notable Members of the Order of the Seventh Codex**

### **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/People/Lareth Dunsvale\|Lareth Dunsvale]]**

Famed as the “Peacemaker of the Border Concord,” Lareth Dunsvale’s calm intellect and moral precision ended a generation of war between rival city-states. Though never officially recognized by the high council, Dunsvale’s private field notes — later unearthed in the Lower Archives — reveal that he was among the first to submit observations of regional anomalies that would eventually form the early Codex. His philosophy of _measured empathy_ continues to guide the Order’s diplomatic doctrine.

### **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/People/Serenya Moonscribe\|Serenya Moonscribe]]**

An explorer, inventor, and archivist without equal, Serenya Moonscribe is credited with creating the arcane-lanterns still used by field agents today. Her luminous tools allowed safe observation of unstable magical currents — a breakthrough that forever changed the Codex’s fieldwork. More than a scholar of light, Moonscribe was a poet of discovery; her journals glow faintly under moonlight, as if they still remember her touch.

### **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/People/Thalric Emberhand\|Thalric Emberhand]]**

When the dragon descended upon Ashvale, it was Thalric Emberhand who stood between flame and the helpless. His heroics saved both the to
wn and several crucial fragments of lost lore. Known for his steadfastness and quiet faith, Thalric transformed his battle scars into lessons — teaching containment and stability magic to generations of field operatives. His rune-etched gauntlets remain on display in the Hall of Witness, eternally warm to the touch.

### **[[Campaigns/WestMarchesStyle/Public/People/Varis Greyveil\|Varis Greyveil]]**

To many within the Order, Varis Greyveil is less a person than a principle — the architect of its bureaucracy and keeper of its intellectual discipline. His _Treatises on Political Harmony_ became required study not only for initiates but also for allied governors. Greyveil’s meticulous record-keeping laid the groundwork for the Codex Indexing System still in use today, his calm logic forming the quiet heart of the Order’s enduring structure.
