**Physical Description:**  
Slender and graceful, with long midnight-blue hair and piercing violet eyes. Wears flowing performance robes adorned with musical symbols and tiny enchanted charms. Often carries multiple finely crafted instruments that glow faintly when magic is present. Moves with the poise of a performer, each gesture precise and expressive.  

**Personality:**  
Passionate and obsessive, viewing music as the ultimate form of transcendence. Calm and charming in public, but utterly single-minded in pursuit of her ultimate symphony. Has little regard for collateral damage if it serves the art.

- Reassemble the soul of a deceased symphony master.  
- Create and perform a perfect magical composition that bridges life and death.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Music is the highest expression of magic and art.  
- Obsession with perfection justifies extreme measures.  

**Flaws:**  
- Detached from the suffering caused by her performances.  
- Overfocus on musical perfection blinds her to practical consequences.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
A secluded, acoustically perfect estate deep in the woods, lined with enchanted instruments and sound-reflective architecture.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Independent; no formal faction membership.  
- Occasionally collaborates with scholars of magic-infused music or arcane instrument makers.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Often hums or plays music subconsciously to focus her thoughts.  
- Leaves behind haunting echoes of her rehearsals that can influence listeners for days.
