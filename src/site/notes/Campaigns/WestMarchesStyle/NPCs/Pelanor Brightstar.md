**Physical Description:**  
A radiant Aasimar whose golden hair and luminous eyes give off a soft ambient glow. His robes are a blend of scholar’s garb and priestly attire, woven with gold filaments that pulse faintly with divine energy.

- “Light without wisdom blinds; wisdom without light corrupts.”  
- All paths to truth are sacred.

The **Luminous Athenaeum**, a great library-temple in Athkatla.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**

- Good standing with the Silver Circle of Scholars.  

**Notes / Quirks:**
