**Physical Description:**  
A broad-shouldered man of Thayan descent, his skin a deep bronze tone that contrasts with the crimson of his robes. His face bears the fullness of age and experience — faint lines at the corners of his eyes, a heavy jaw softened by years rather than chiseled by vanity. His dark hair, streaked with silver, is worn long and tied back beneath an ornate circlet of black iron etched with runes. His piercing gray eyes seem almost metallic under torchlight. His robes of deep red and obsidian are lined with sigils of warding and power, embroidered in gold thread that glimmers faintly when he channels magic.

**Personality:**  
Measured and imperious. Speaks slowly, as though each word is a spell to be weighed before release. Displays calm authority — not through fury, but through an unshakable sense of superiority.
