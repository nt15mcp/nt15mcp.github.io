[[Ilythar.jpg]]

**Physical Description:**  
Tall, ethereal-looking elf with silver-blonde hair that floats slightly as if in a breeze. Piercing gray eyes with a faint psionic glow. Wears minimalistic flowing robes designed to not restrict movement, often adorned with subtle geometric patterns that shimmer faintly. Moves gracefully, almost weightless, giving the impression of being detached from the physical world.

**Personality:**  
Detached and visionary, utterly convinced that his psionic manipulations are liberating mortals. Calm and analytical, often viewing people as tools or experiments. Speaks softly, with occasional cryptic metaphors.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Force enlightenment via psionic influence.  
- Impose a mental awakening across the region, believing it will free minds from ignorance.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Knowledge and mental clarity are the highest virtues.  
- Mortals must be guided to enlightenment, even without their consent.  

**Flaws:**  
- Indifferent to suffering caused by his actions.  
- Obsessive and single-minded, often underestimating the consequences of large-scale manipulation.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
A hidden tower embedded in the cliffs near the Dessarin River, accessible only through psionically attuned wards and invisible portals.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- No formal alliances; operates independently.  
- Occasionally interacts indirectly with scholars and arcane researchers interested in psionics, but generally unknown.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Uses small floating crystals to amplify psionic influence.  
- Often hums or whispers to himself in tonal patterns that subtly manipulate emotions.  
- Fascinated by mundane human rituals, observing them as if they were experimental variables.
