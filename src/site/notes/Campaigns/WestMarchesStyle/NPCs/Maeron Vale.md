**Physical Description:**  
A stern man with jet-black hair streaked in silver, wearing polished steel armor over a dark crimson surcoat. His gaze is intense, almost predatory, and a faint burn mark in the shape of a holy sigil mars his right cheek.  

**Personality:**  
Disciplined, relentless, and utterly convinced of divine justice.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Purge corruption and heresy within the faith and beyond.  
- Enforce the Dawnforged doctrine through law and fear if necessary.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- “Mercy is for the penitent. Justice is for all.”  
- The ends justify divine means.  

**Flaws:**  
- Lacks compassion; sees dissent as defiance.  
- Haunted by past executions that may have been unjust.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
Operates from **The Flameward Bastion**, a fortress-temple in Amn’s northern hills.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Dawnforged Circle (Inquisitor Commander)  
- Coordinates with the Order of the Gauntlet.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Keeps a book of “Unanswered Sins” — names of those he failed to bring to justice.  
- Never removes his gloves in public.
