**Physical Description:**  
Shifts between humanoid and semi-ethereal forms, often appearing as a tall figure wreathed in faintly glowing, ever-shifting light. Features are angular and indistinct, with eyes that shimmer like stars. Occasionally flickers with glimpses of other planes. Moves silently and fluidly, with an unsettling calm.  

**Personality:**  
Aloof and indifferent to mortal suffering. Curious and analytical, treating magical energy as a resource or currency. Detached observer, rarely intervening unless it serves his collection goals.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Collect rare magical essences from other planes.  
- Consolidate these essences into a single repository for study and experimentation.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Knowledge and magical understanding above all.  
- Energy and essence are tools to be harnessed efficiently.  

**Flaws:**  
- Indifferent to collateral damage; mortality of others is irrelevant.  
- Overconfidence in his extraplanar understanding can blind him to unintended consequences.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
A partially anchored planar node, a pocket space that exists between Material Plane and an unstable astral nexus.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Independent; does not ally with mortal factions.  
- Occasionally manipulated by or sought after by arcane researchers or planar scholars.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Occasionally leaves traces of exotic planar flora and fauna near rifts.  
- Communicates in abstract visions or cryptic symbols instead of words.  
- Appears to "catalog" every rift he opens, marking locations with subtle planar sigils.
