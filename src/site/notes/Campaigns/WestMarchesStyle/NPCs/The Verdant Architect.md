**Physical Description:**  
A towering treant of immense age, his bark is blackened with veins of green luminescence that pulse like slow heartbeats. Moss and vines cascade from his limbs like beards and hair, and sap glows faintly where his “veins” meet the earth. His eyes are hollowed, filled with drifting motes of green light that shift in intensity as he speaks. When he moves, the sound is like creaking glaciers and groaning roots.

**Personality:**  
Stoic and deliberate, speaking in slow, rumbling tones as though every word costs a decade. Considers mortals fleeting insects — destructive but not beyond correction. When angered, his speech becomes like thunder, his vines twitching with restrained violence.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Restore the natural order by reclaiming land consumed by cities and farms.  
- Erase “unsustainable” civilization and replace it with living wilderness.  
- Ensure that life — wild, untamed, and enduring — outlasts the age of mortals.

**Values / Ideals:**  
- **Cycle:** All things must grow, decay, and renew. Civilization interrupts this sacred rhythm.  
- **Patience:** True change comes with the slowness of seasons and centuries.  
- **Balance through Renewal:** Destruction is simply the first step in rebirth.  

**Flaws:**  
- Inflexible — cannot distinguish between harmony and domination.  
- Fails to recognize mortal innocence; punishes all for the sins of the few.  
- His patience turns to apathy; willing to let countless die for future “equilibrium.”  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
Deep within the **Heartgrove Expanse**, a sentient and ever-expanding forest south of the Reaching Woods. The central glade — **Elderseed Hollow** — contains an ancient monolith etched with primordial druidic runes that amplify his will across miles of wilderness.

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- **Allies:** The **Verdant Enclave** (though they fear his extremism), some circles of the **Emerald Enclave** who still debate his intent.  
- **Rivals:** The **Iron Sigil** (industrial expansion), **Merchant Lords**, and the **Lord’s Alliance** (whose cities encroach on his forests).  
- **Unknown Connection:** May be secretly influenced or corrupted by a druidic offshoot known as the **Circle of the Deep Root**, whose members believe he is the avatar of an elder nature god long forgotten.

**Notes:**  
- Speaks of time in plant metaphors — “When the last harvest withers,” “When roots outlast stone.”  
- Refuses to step within a city’s bounds; sends “sap-born avatars” (smaller treant offshoots) instead.  
- Sometimes bargains with mortals, offering power or protection in exchange for rewilding lands.
