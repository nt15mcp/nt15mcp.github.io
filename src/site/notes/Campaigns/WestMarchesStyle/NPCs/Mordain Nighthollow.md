[[Mordain_Nighthollow.jpg]]

**Physical Description:**  
A tall, wiry man with unkempt dark hair streaked with silver. Eyes bright and alert, constantly scanning his surroundings. Wears robes layered with arcane symbols and clockwork trinkets. Often carries a staff topped with a rotating, crystalline hourglass that glows faintly. Movements are precise, almost jittery, like a person running on too little sleep.

**Personality:**  
Curious, eccentric, and obsessed with temporal experiments. Fascinated by paradoxes and the implications of small changes in time. Often loses patience with those who do not understand or respect his work. Speaks rapidly, jumping between ideas.

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Understand and control the flow of time.  
- Test “optimal outcomes” by reshaping local history through temporal experiments.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Knowledge and discovery are paramount.  
- Time is a resource to be studied, manipulated, and optimized.  

**Flaws:**  
- Obsessive focus on experiments can blind him to immediate consequences.  
- Disregard for collateral damage; considers most effects “necessary for understanding.”  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
A secluded tower surrounded by temporal anomalies near the High Forest. Its interior shifts slightly in time, making navigation difficult for outsiders.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- No formal alliances; operates independently.  
- Occasionally consults with arcane scholars interested in temporal magic but is generally isolated.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Keeps dozens of intricate clocks and devices ticking simultaneously.  
- Talks to “future selves” in cryptic mutterings, confusing anyone nearby.  
- Collects artifacts displaced in time, often storing duplicates from alternate timelines.
