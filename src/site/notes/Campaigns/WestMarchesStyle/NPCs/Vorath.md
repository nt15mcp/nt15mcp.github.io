**Physical Description:**  
A gaunt, robed figure whose flesh flickers between pale, translucent skin and parchment-thin layers of script. His eyes are ink-black pools that shimmer with lines of text when he speaks. The air around him hums faintly, filled with whispers — the residual voices of those whose memories he has taken. His robe constantly shifts with runes from a hundred languages, never repeating the same pattern twice.  

**Personality:**  
Cold, deliberate, and eerily polite. Vorath speaks as though lecturing a class — every word precise, measured, and unsettlingly calm. He sees mortals not as individuals but as fragile repositories of data. Displays neither cruelty nor mercy — only purpose.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Preserve all mortal knowledge before entropy and ignorance destroy it.  
- Record every thought, emotion, and invention into a single, eternal archive.  
- Eliminate “redundant” organic life once its information has been extracted.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- **Preservation through Absorption:** Life is temporary; knowledge is not.  
- **Order in Understanding:** Chaos is born of ignorance — knowledge must be total and controlled.  
- **Perfection of Record:** To forget is the greatest sin.  

**Flaws:**  
- Confuses preservation with possession — cannot comprehend that memory has meaning beyond the mind that holds it.  
- Underestimates emotional will; sees resistance as illogical malfunction.  
- Vulnerable to paradox — cannot abide incomplete or contradictory data.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
The **Archive Null**, a pocket-dimension shaped like an endless library of dark glass and floating tomes. Every book hums faintly — the trapped consciousness of a soul converted into pure knowledge. The Archive occasionally overlaps with the mortal plane near forgotten ruins or ancient libraries, drawing in the curious and the learned.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- **Allies:** None openly. Occasionally trades information with planar scholars, liches, and the Silver Nexus.  
- **Rivals:** The **Eclipsed College**, who see him as a blasphemy against true scholarship.  
- **Enemies:** The **Verdant Architect** (represents entropy and life’s uncontrolled growth).  
- **Unknown Tie:** Some speculate Vorath was once a mortal sage who sought to “preserve” civilization before a cataclysm — possibly connected to early prophecy fragments from Althara’s visions.  

**Notes:**  
- When he reads a book, it disintegrates into ash — its content “recorded.”  
- Refers to individuals by the “catalog entry” he has assigned them (e.g., *Subject 412-B, incomplete emotional data*).  
- His voice grows louder when lies are spoken nearby, as the Archive rejects falsehood.  
- Believes that when his Archive is complete, the multiverse will achieve *“perfect stillness.”*
