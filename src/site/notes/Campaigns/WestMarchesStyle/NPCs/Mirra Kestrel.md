**Physical Description:**  
A wiry woman in plain traveler's garb, her dark hair cropped short and her face perpetually smudged with soot and ink. Her expression is alert, her eyes darting to corners even while she smiles.  

**Personality:**  
Sharp-tongued and perpetually restless. Has the soul of a spy and the paranoia of a survivor.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Maintain the Crimson Hand’s intelligence network.  
- Gather compromising secrets for leverage or sale.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- “Everyone’s got a secret worth buying.”  
- Trust is a currency that always depreciates.  

**Flaws:**  
- Sleeps little, trusts no one.  
- Addicted to risk — the more dangerous the infiltration, the more she wants it.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
Rotates between safehouses across the Sword Coast; main base rumored near Waterdeep’s Dock Ward.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Crimson Hand Consortium (Master of Whispers)  
- Informal ties with the Harpers — though neither side admits it.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Carries a dozen coded maps sewn into her clothing lining.  
- Collects false identities as trophies.
