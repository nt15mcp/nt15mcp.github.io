**Physical Description:**  
Tall and radiant, with hair that flickers like living embers. Skin glows faintly like molten stone, and eyes burn with molten gold light. Wears flowing robes of red and orange that seem to shimmer with heat. When moving, small sparks trail her footsteps, and heat radiates subtly from her presence.  

**Personality:**  
Proud and intense, singularly focused on her vision of purification through fire. Believes destruction is morally justified to achieve a “perfect natural cycle.” Calm and regal in demeanor, but ruthless in execution. Detached from the suffering she causes, seeing it as a necessary cost for rebirth.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Renew the land through controlled fire and rebirth.  
- Purge civilization to restore what she perceives as a “perfect natural cycle.”  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Destruction can serve a higher purpose.  
- Reveres cycles of death and rebirth in nature.  
- Believes suffering is acceptable if it leads to renewal.  

**Flaws:**  
- Obsessive in her pursuit of “purity,” underestimating collateral damage.  
- Morally rigid; unable to compromise her vision even to avoid unnecessary deaths.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
A volcanic mountain peak surrounded by scorched and regenerating forests, where she maintains a magical hearth that fuels her fire-aligned powers.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Independent; does not formally ally with any faction.  
- Occasionally interacts with elemental cults or fire-worshiping sects, but mostly solitary.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Can ignite small flames unconsciously when emotionally agitated.  
- Leaves perfectly charred symbols in the ground as “signs of purification.”  
- Observes natural cycles and marks celestial events for ritualistic fires.
