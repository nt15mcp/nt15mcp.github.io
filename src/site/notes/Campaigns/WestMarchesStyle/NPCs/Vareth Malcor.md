[[Vareth_Malcor.jpg]]

**Physical Description:**  
A tall, lean tiefling with dusky red skin and a pair of curved black horns polished to a gleam. His attire is that of a noble merchant — silks, rings, and jeweled gloves — but his crimson eyes betray calculation rather than refinement.  

**Personality:**  
Smooth, calculating, and urbane. Speaks like a diplomat, schemes like a crime lord.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Manipulate regional trade and war economies for maximum profit.  
- Maintain neutrality among factions to act as a silent broker.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- “Information is coin. Coin is control.”  
- Power should flow to those clever enough to seize it.  

**Flaws:**  
- Obsessed with control; cannot abide being outmaneuvered.  
- Considers loyalty a weakness.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
The **Gilded Web**, an underground exchange beneath Baldur’s Gate.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Crimson Hand Consortium (De Facto Leader)  
- Occasional collaboration with the Zhentarim and Merchant Lords.  

**Notes / Quirks:**  
- Keeps ledgers written in invisible ink visible only under infernal firelight.  
- Never touches gold directly — all payments go through intermediaries.
