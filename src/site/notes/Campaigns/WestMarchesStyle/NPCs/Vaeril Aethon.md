[[Vaeril_Aethon.jpg]]

**Physical Description:**  
A tall, silver-haired high elf with warm, golden-olive skin and pale, luminous eyes. Intricate clockwork filigree traces elegant patterns across his skin, glowing softly like runic gold. His flowing robes shimmer with subtle geometric light, and his voice carries a calm, measured precision — every word deliberate, every motion a study in poise.

**Personality:**  
Methodical, detached, and quietly condescending. Speaks as though every conversation is a logical proof. Rarely raises his voice, even in crisis.

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Create a flawless society free from chaos, inefficiency, and emotional error.  
- Connect all magical and mechanical constructs into a single, coordinated “optimization” network.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- “Perfection through design.”  
- Belief that emotion and free will are weaknesses to be optimized out of existence.  

**Flaws:**  
- Emotionally stunted; unable to empathize.  
- Believes every loss is acceptable if it leads to greater systemic stability.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
The Argent Foundry — a towering, hidden complex near the Troll Hills powered by arcane ley lines.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- Founder of the Silver Nexus - Archmagister.  
- Former associate of the Silver Circle of Scholars (now shunned for his experiments).
