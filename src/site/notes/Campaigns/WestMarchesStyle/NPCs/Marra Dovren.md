**Physical Description:**  
Once a human artificer, now heavily modified with construct-like prosthetics. Her eyes are replaced with crystalline lenses that flicker with magical light.  

**Personality:**  
Pragmatic and loyal. Believes in Marra’s vision but still feels faint empathy for “unoptimized” beings — a conflict that causes her great distress.  

**Motives / Goals:**  
- Maintain construct harmony and prevent “inefficient” malfunctions.  
- Prove that mortals can coexist with the Nexus without losing autonomy.  

**Values / Ideals:**  
- Discipline and structure, but tempered with compassion.  

**Flaws:**  
- Haunted by the loss of her humanity. Struggles against total emotional suppression.  

**Residence / Home Base:**  
Operates out of **The Harmonium Works**, a disguised workshop in Elturel’s outskirts, posing as a prosthetics clinic.  

**Factions / Political Alliances:**  
- The Silver Nexus - "The Calibrator"
- Secretly sympathetic to the Order of the Gauntlet (believes they could “guide” the Nexus toward good).  
- Monitored closely by Vaelith for deviation.
