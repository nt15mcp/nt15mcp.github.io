Tall and elegant, with pale skin and long silver hair that falls like a waterfall. Eyes shimmer like opals, hinting at deep sorrow. Wears flowing dark robes trimmed with silver runes. Often carries a staff topped with a crystal containing faintly glowing threads, pulsing with latent magic. Moves gracefully, with a quiet, deliberate presence.

A secluded, magically warded tower deep in the High Forest, partially shifted out of phase with the material plane.
