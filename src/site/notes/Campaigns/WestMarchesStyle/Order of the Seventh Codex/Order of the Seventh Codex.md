# Charter
**The Order of the Seventh Codex exists to identify and address unusual or dangerous disturbances before they escalate.**

**Our mission is threefold:**

1. **Identify** anomalies, rumors, and unexplained phenomena to determine their nature and potential impact.
    
2. **Address** threats efficiently, stabilizing situations before they can spread or worsen.
    
3. **Preserve** discoveries in the Codex, safeguarding the future.
    

The Order does not act for glory, judgment, or dominion. Members proceed with measured diligence, taking the necessary steps to handle matters beyond ordinary oversight.

# Motto
Identify. Address. Preserve.

The Order intervenes **before disturbances escalate**, investigating anomalies, stabilizing threats, and recording all findings in the Codex to safeguard the future.  
Success is measured by foresight and effectiveness, not by acclaim.

# Crest
![OrderOfTheSeventhCodexCrest.png](/img/user/_assets/WestMarchesStyle/OrderOfTheSeventhCodexCrest.png)
**Primary Iconography:**  
A **seven-pointed star** floats above an **open codex**, its pages slightly fanned as if caught mid-flip. The star symbolizes **completeness and the Order’s structure**, as well as the “Seventh Codex” itself.

**Centerpiece:**  
At the heart of the star rests a **watchful eye**, representing vigilance, scrutiny, and the Order’s proactive observation of threats.

**Supporting Elements:**  
Beneath the codex, a **pair of interlocking keys** forms a subtle semicircle, symbolizing both **access to hidden knowledge** and the **ability to seal dangerous information or artifacts**.  
Delicate filigree lines radiate outward, evoking networks of connections — the spread of information and the careful tracing of anomalies.

**Color Palette:**

- **Deep indigo:** mystery, scholarship, insight
    
- **Silver:** clarity, observation, precision
    
- **Gold accents:** illumination, preservation, importance
    

**Usage Notes:**  
The emblem is versatile: embroidered on cloaks, etched onto signet rings, stamped on Codex entries, and displayed on the Order’s banners. The eye and codex are always the central focus, ensuring recognizability.

### **Founding Rumors**

These are **four possible explanations** for why the Order of the Seventh Codex was created. They exist in lore, speculation, and fragmentary Codex entries — the “true” reason may be a combination of these:

1. **The Cataclysm That Wasn’t**
    
    - Rumor says the guild formed after a failed magical experiment or planar tear almost destroyed a city. The founders wanted to ensure that no such threat could ever go unnoticed again.
        
    - Implication: they were motivated by **preventive vigilance** and containment.
        
2. **The Scholars’ Pact**
    
    - Some say it began as a secret society of scholars and adventurers who wanted to **preserve knowledge of dangerous creatures and phenomena**, fearing it might be lost to time or misused.
        
    - Implication: the Codex’s documentation was central from the beginning.
        
3. **The Mercenary Turned Mentor**
    
    - A legendary adventurer-turned-teacher is said to have seen **the chaos ordinary forces caused when dealing with unknown threats** and convinced a few trusted peers to organize systematic responses.
        
    - Implication: the Order was founded as a **practical field response organization**, not just a scholarly club.
        
4. **The Forgotten Threat**
    
    - Ancient entries hint that a mysterious threat — perhaps a cult, monster, or rogue magical device — prompted the founders to band together. Some say the original event has been **deliberately erased from memory** to avoid panic.
        
    - Implication: the guild’s origins are **intentionally shrouded**, lending a slightly enigmatic tone.
        

> **Flavor Note:** All four could be partially true, creating a **layered, mysterious origin story**. Different regions, scholars, and Codex entries may emphasize different versions.

# Founding and Structure
The Order operates as an **independent organization** sustained through a combination of member contributions, recovered spoils, and occasional external patronage. It is not beholden to any crown, temple, or faction — allowing it to act where others hesitate.

**Primary Sources:**

- **Spoils Tithe:** A portion (typically 50–70%) of all gold, valuables, and recovered assets from missions is turned over to the Order.
    
    - These funds maintain guild halls, pay staff and scribes, fund expeditions, and support research into contained anomalies.
        
    - The tithe also covers lodging, meals, and basic equipment for active members.
        
- **Patronage:** Cities, lords, or guilds occasionally offer payments or donations for the Order’s assistance in resolving disturbances. These contributions are accepted with no promise of loyalty.
    
- **Historic Endowments:** Some ancient benefactors left holdings, libraries, and vaults that regional halls draw from.
    

**Adventurer Compensation:**

- Members keep personal items, consumables, and minor treasures gained in the field.
    
- Dangerous or anomalous items are **requisitioned** into the Order’s vaults for study and containment.
    
- Exceptional service is rewarded through advancement, commendations, and occasional access to guild resources or relics.
    

> 💡 _This structure grounds the world’s economy and frames adventuring as duty and curiosity, not mere treasure hunting._

# Reputation and Culture
### **Public Perception**

- **Respected but Reserved:** Most view the Order as a capable, if sometimes enigmatic, force that deals with “the strange and the unseen.”
